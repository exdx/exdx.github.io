## About me
I'm a software engineer interested in distributed systems, cryptocurrencies, and cloud computing. [My GitHub](https://github.com/exdx) is a pretty accurate representation of what I'm up to. 

I am currently working on [Avalanche](https://www.avax.network) at Ava Labs. Previously I worked at Red Hat, as well as a variety of early-stage startups focused on cloud computing, Ethereum development and cryptocurrency trading.

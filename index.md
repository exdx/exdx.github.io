## About me
I'm a software engineer with interests in distributed systems, cryptocurrencies, and cloud computing. Currently working on OpenShift at Red Hat as a member of the [operator-framework](https://github.com/operator-framework) team. Previously I worked at a variety of early-stage startups focused on cloud computing, Ethereum development and cryptocurrency trading. 

Outside of coding, my hobbies include skateboarding, hiking, playing soccer, and other fun things that don't involve a computer. My cat's name is Pepper a.k.a. Pepo.
